Solarized Wikipedia Theme

## Solarized Theme
Solarized color palette was created by <a rel="author" href="http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized">Ethan Schoonover</a> in two modes - dark and light - basically for people/coders who use terminal like environment. It is available for various text editors and IDEs and some of them are now bundeled with them by default.

Those who read wikipedia for long hours may have noticed that it is sometimes stressfull for your eyes with basic themes of wikipedia. Especially on large monitors small fonts/text hurt your eyes after prolonged reading. So I have created a dark version of Solorized theme for wikipedia.

If anybody interested can create a light version of this too as I almost always use dark themes for my editors and browsers. They help me read in low light conditions without much stress on eyes.
